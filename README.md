<h1>Introduction</h1>
This project aims to utilize regression analysis to understand the underlying parameters which influence the pricing of HDB resale flats in 
Singapore. This initiative is an exploratory project meant to gain exposure to building models utilizing real world data and gain further
experience in analytics.


<h1>Project Goals</h1>
  <ul>
    <li> To explore and quantify the parameters which influence HDB resale pricing within the North-East sector </li>
    <li> Develop pricing models to evaluate the true value of a resale flat based on its characteristic </li>
    <li> Showcase analytical skillsets </li>
  </ul>


<h1>How it works</h1>
The project data are sourced from government websites such as data.gov and onemap.gov and the analysis is done based on basic fundamenetal
understanding and intuition of the effects between parameters and pricing. The project codes can be found in the "Code" folder while datasets
are stored in the "Data" folder. Overall analysis is showcase within the HDB_Analysis.pdf file.
